# Registry Role Vocabulary

This vocabulary contains the roles of people and organisations as they are defined within the ISO's standard _19135, Procedures for item registration_ [1]. Some small additions have been made, for example the role of _Submitter_.

These roles are used by the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](https://www.linked.data.gov.au) to govern the persistent idnetifier that they issue for Linked Data resources. See the WG's [Guidlines document](https://www.linked.data.gov.au/guidelines) for more information.
